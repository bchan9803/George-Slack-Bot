George is a digital beaver, who seeks to make your private Slack channel a functional and efficient workplace.


Here is a helpful guide for some of the functions included with George:

  1) `;help` - Use this command followed by your question, so that the channel owner can quickly come to assist you. :hand:
  
  2) `;time` - This command will trigger the current date and time. :alarm_clock:
  
  3) `;happy bday` - Use this command to send someone in the chat a nice b-day GIF! :gift: :partying_face:
  
  4) `;beaver` - A easter egg that sends a GIF of "George the Beaver" from Duck Dynasty. :duck:
  
  6) `;happy` - Posts a happy face GIF to express your happiness! :blush:
  
  7) `;thumbs up` - Agree with someone? Use the Phil Robertson iconic "thumbs up" GIF to display your agreement. :+1:
  
  8) `;homie` - Feel the need to display your inner Uncle Si? Use this command to display his iconic quote, "Homie don't play that". :duck::man-gesturing-no:

  Forgot the commands? Use the `;guide` command to display the command list.



How to get started:

  1) In the main.py file, copy your Slack user ID, and paste it into the variable "owner-user-id", underneath the comment "Main". 
  2) Run the program!
